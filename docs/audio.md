Meeting Audio
=============

This page contains instructions for recording and posting meeting audio.

Using Mac OS X
--------------

This section contains instructions using free Mac OS X applications.

For recording the meeting, I found that the free iPhone app called
[Super Note][super-note] by Clear Sky Apps works well.  Here is a
screen shot:

After recording the meeting, Super Note lets you download the audio file
to your computer using DropBox.  The audio file format is [AIFF][aiff],
which is a file format created by Apple and works with iTunes, etc.
A 10-minute meeting resulted in a file less than 6MB.
